### Getting started

Install postgresql:

Then create user tkt_oodi and database tk_oodi from dump.sql file by following these steps: 

Run:

`sudo su postgres`

`psql`Ã¤
After this you should be working as:

`postgres=#` 

Then contact admin to get the password and run the following commands: 

```
CREATE USER tkt_oodi WITH PASSWORD 'insertPasswordHere';
CREATE DATABASE tkt_oodi;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE tkt_oodi TO tkt_oodi;
\q
```
Now put the dump data to the tkt_oodi db: 

`psql tkt_oodi < dump.sql`

And the db has been set up.

To look into the tkt_oodi db in terminal run:

`psql -h 127.0.0.1 -d tkt_oodi -U tkt_oodi -W`

and enter the password.

wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
cd redis-stable

sudo make install
redis-server
